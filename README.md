$ cp package.json ../
$ cd ..
$ npm install
```
After you are done your folder structure should look like this
```
rubber-duck
  ├─── Rubber-Duck
  │       ├─── https://glitch.com/edit/#!/rubber-ducks-git-pullpackage.json
  │       └─── ...
  ├─── node_modules
  │       └─── ...
  ├─── .env
  └─── package.json
```


**Please note:** Because of how the bot is currently hosted on glitch.com you have to copy the package.json up one folder so that it contained in the same folder as the project folder you cloned off github.<br />
All changes to package.json must be made to both versions in order for the bot to correctly work.


## Running the bot
Make sure you are in the outer rubber-duck folder and run<br />
```
$ npm start
```
This project is powered by SISMAN technologies, a subdivision of the RPI Technologies Group.
